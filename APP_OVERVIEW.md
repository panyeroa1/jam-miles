# App Overview: Miles - Startup Mentor AI

Miles is a specialized voice-first assistant designed for "Jamjam," a teen interested in software development startups. Created by "Master E," Miles provides practical coaching using a "warm, curious, and supportive" tone.

## Features
- **Adaptive Learning Profile**: Miles observes and mirrors Jamjam's learning style. He tracks preferences for technical depth, pace, and interests, persisting this "mental model" in Supabase.
- **Proactive Silence Handling (VAD)**: If Jamjam is quiet for 10s, Miles uses his updated Learner Profile to bring back relevant context or share a new insight that fits Jamjam's interests.
- **Action Control Bar**: A sleek, iOS-inspired footer bar that allows toggling Camera, Screen Share, and active conversation states.
- **Master E Context**: Miles recognizes Master E as his world-class engineer creator.
- **Ultra-Human Personality**: Breathy, repetitive, and supportive "Sesame" delivery.
- **Native Multi-Lingual Adaptation**: Detects and responds natively in any language.
- **Long-term Memory**: Persists conversation history and learner metadata in Supabase.
- **Immersive Visualizer**: Organic breathing orb that reacts to speech frequency and can overlay video feeds.
